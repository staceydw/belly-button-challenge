# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 JavaScript Challenge

For this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Visualizations include bar and bubble charts of the OTU samples, which allows the user to see the demographic information for each individual. The participant's ID number is used as the search requirement; then the charts adjust to reflect the selected participant's information. 

Resources for this challenge include use of the provided sample code (included in this repository) as well as the use of ChatGPT to debug an error that had prevented the plotting of the bar chart.
